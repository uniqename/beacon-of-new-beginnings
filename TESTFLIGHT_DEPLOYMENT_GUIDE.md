    # Fix deployment target for all pods
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '14.0'
      config.build_settings['EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]'] = 'arm64'
      
      # Fix other common iOS build issues
      config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
        '$(inherited)',
        'PERMISSION_LOCATION=1',
        'PERMISSION_NOTIFICATIONS=1',
      ]
    end
  end
end
```

### Step 2: Clean and Rebuild Dependencies
```bash
# Clean everything
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock .symlinks
