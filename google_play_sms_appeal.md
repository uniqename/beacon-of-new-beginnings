# Google Play SMS Appeal - Under 1000 Characters

**Subject:** Appeal for SMS Permissions Rejection - Beacon of New Beginnings

Dear Google Play Review Team,

We respectfully appeal the SMS permissions rejection for "Beacon of New Beginnings" (com.beaconnewbeginnings.ngo_support_app). This rejection appears to be in error.

**Technical Evidence:**
- AndroidManifest.xml line 9: "SEND_SMS removed - using url_launcher with sms: scheme instead"
- NO SMS permissions requested in current build
- Uses standard url_launcher with sms: scheme (like mailto: links)
- No SMS-related code or libraries included

**App Purpose:**
Crisis support app for domestic violence survivors in Ghana providing anonymous access to emergency resources.

**Emergency Contact Implementation:**
Our app uses sms: scheme URLs to open the user's default messaging app with pre-populated emergency messages. This is standard Android functionality requiring NO special permissions.

**Request:**
Please re-review our submission. We have completely removed all SMS permissions and functionality. Our emergency contact feature uses the recommended url_launcher approach.

This app serves vulnerable individuals in crisis. Please expedite approval.

Thank you.
