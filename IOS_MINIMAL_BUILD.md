# üçé iOS Minimal Build Solution

## Issue: Firebase Compatibility
The iOS build is failing due to Firebase pods incompatibility with current Xcode version.

## Quick Solution: Minimal iOS Build

### Step 1: Create iOS-Only Pubspec
Create `pubspec_ios.yaml` without Firebase:

```yaml
name: ngo_support_app
description: "Beacon of New Beginnings - iOS Build"
version: 1.0.0+1

environment:
  sdk: ^3.8.1

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8
  geolocator: ^10.1.0
  geocoding: ^2.1.1
  url_launcher: ^6.2.2
  image_picker: ^1.0.4
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
  provider: ^6.1.1
  intl: ^0.19.0
  encrypt: ^5.0.1
  uuid: ^4.2.1

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^5.0.0

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

### Step 2: Build Commands
```bash
# Use minimal pubspec
cp pubspec.yaml pubspec_backup.yaml
cp pubspec_ios.yaml pubspec.yaml

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Build iOS
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

### Step 3: Add Firebase Later
After successful iOS archive, restore Firebase:
```bash
cp pubspec_backup.yaml pubspec.yaml
flutter pub get
```

## Alternative: Professional iOS Help
This Firebase/Xcode issue requires:
- Latest Xcode version
- Firebase SDK version management
- Advanced iOS build configuration

Consider hiring iOS developer for 2-4 hours to resolve.
